	<h2 style="color:yellow">Early Life</h2>
	<p style="color:yellow"><i>Albert Einstein</i> was born on March 14, 1879, in Ulm, Germany, to a middle-class Jewish family.
	He showed an early interest in science and mathematics, particularly fascinated by a geometry book at the age of twelve.
	 Despite his brilliance, he struggled in school due to a rigid educational system that did not cater to his curiosity.</p>
